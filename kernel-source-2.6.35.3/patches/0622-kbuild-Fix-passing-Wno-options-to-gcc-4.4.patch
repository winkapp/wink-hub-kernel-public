Subject: [PATCH 622/670] kbuild: Fix passing -Wno-* options to gcc 4.4+

Starting with 4.4, gcc will happily accept -Wno-<anything> in the
cc-option test and complain later when compiling a file that has some
other warning. This rather unexpected behavior is intentional as per
http://gcc.gnu.org/PR28322, so work around it by testing for support of
the opposite option (without the no-). Introduce a new Makefile function
cc-disable-warning that does this and update two uses of cc-option in
the toplevel Makefile.

+    cc-disable-warning
+	cc-disable-warning checks if gcc supports a given warning and returns
+	the commandline switch to disable it. This special function is needed,
+	because gcc 4.4 and later accept any unknown -Wno-* option and only
+	warn about it if there is another warning in the source file.
+
+	Example:
+		KBUILD_CFLAGS += $(call cc-disable-warning, unused-but-set-variable)
+
+	In the above example, -Wno-unused-but-set-variable will be added to
+	KBUILD_CFLAGS only if gcc really accepts it.

     cc-version
 	cc-version returns a numerical version of the $(CC) compiler version.
 	The format is <major><minor> where both are two digits. So for example
